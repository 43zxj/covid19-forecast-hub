Further team members (GATech) regularly          participate in other forecasting, epidemiological tasks like inference, detection, interventions etc and (IQVIA/UIUC) healthcare problems like patient trajectory analysis etc. model_name: DeepCOVIDmodel_abbr: DeepCOVIDmodel_output: https://deepcovid.github.io/ model_repo: model_contributors: B.

As the model is updated each week, the effect of any new intervention is taken into account via the changes in the input data. methods_long: >-    May 11 - This data-driven deep learning model learns the dependence of hospitalization and mortality rate on various detailed syndromic, demographic, mobility and clinical data (such as increase in positive Covid tests etc) from historical data. The learned model is then used to predict mortality and hospitalization at various points in future. To compensate for the effects of noise (in data and initialization), the model is bootstrapped on several subsamples and then aggregated. The model also propagates uncertainties in the data to show the confidence intervals in the forecasts.citation: See publications at https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/covid.html. Cite B.
