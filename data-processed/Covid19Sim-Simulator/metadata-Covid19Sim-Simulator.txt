    The COVID-19 Simulator uses a validated compartment model to simulate the trajectory of COVID-19 at the state level from March 15, 2020 to August 31, 2020 in the United States. Utilizing the most recent data for each state, the COVID-19 Simulator considers state-specific disease spread dynamics. Specifically, to reproduce the observed trends and project future cases of COVID-19, time-varying and state-specific effective reproductive numbers are estimated and fed as inputs into a compartment model. The compartment model is defined using Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered compartments (i.e., SEIR model) with continuous time progression. Model programming and analysis were performed in R (version 3.6.2), and the package deSolve was used to solve the ordinary differential equation system.
