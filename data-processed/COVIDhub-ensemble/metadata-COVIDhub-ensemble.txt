this_model_is_unconditional: false

methods: >-
    The ensemble combines models unconditional on particular interventions
    being in place with those conditional on existing social distancing measures
    continuing. Models are combined by taking arithmetic averages of quantiles and
    point estimates.

methods_long: >-
    April 13: At state level, only two models included in first week, LANL and IHME,
    due to overlaps in location and reported quantiles. At national level, IHME
    was combined with the three CU models.
    April 27: Different component models at state level and national level.
    Please see the model information file for more details.
    May 4: National ensemble combined 7 models, state ensembles combined between 2
    and 8 models. For details, see
    ensemble-metadata/state-weight-information.csv
    All ensembles were equally weighted among all eligible models.
    May 19: See ensemble-metadata/2020-05-19-model-eligibility.csv for models
    included/excluded at each location with reasons, and
    ensemble-metadata/2020-05-19-model-weights.csv for weights by location.
