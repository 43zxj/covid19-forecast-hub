    We aim to predict COVID-19 daily new cases using a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model and predict  cumulative deaths from predicted cumulative cases using a time-lagged regression model. We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the transmission rate using a natural experiment design and quantify uncertainty by permutation. We use a regression model to predict cumulative deaths from predicted time-lagged cumulative total number of cases.
