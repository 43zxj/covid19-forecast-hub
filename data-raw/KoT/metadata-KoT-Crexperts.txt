April 22: Experts in the modeling of infectious disease, public health, and epidemiology provide forecasts of the smallest, most likely, and largest possible cumulative number of deaths at the US level. We transform each expert's three estimates into a triangular probability distribution and take an equally-weighted average of expert predictive densities.
