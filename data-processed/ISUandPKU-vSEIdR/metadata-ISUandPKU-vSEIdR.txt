    May 23: We propose an extended varying coefficient Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (vSEIdR) model, which extends the classical epidemic SIR and SEIR models by allowing infections in the exposed E state. This would better capture the COVID-19 reality that most infections are made before clinical diagnosed.
