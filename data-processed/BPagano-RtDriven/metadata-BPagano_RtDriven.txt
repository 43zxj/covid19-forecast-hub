methods_long: "We make daily projections for infections and deaths for \
  \108 countries, 52 US states/territories, and 63 US counties. \
  \We calculate mortality rates by US region and time based on the \
  \ages of people infected in a given region. \
  \We provide the following data as a function of time and place: \
  \confirmed case-based effective transmission ratio, \
  \death-based effective transmission ratio, \
  \fraction of population infected and constant infections transmission ratio, \
  \probability of Covid-19 contact, \
  \mortality and undercount, and 
  \fraction of positive tests. \n\
  \Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio (Rt). \
  \We process Rt change data through the course of the pandemic and apply that \
  \data to forecast infections and deaths."
