  County-level metapopulation model with commuting and stochastic SEIR disease dynamics.
  Our model takes as input data explicit indicators of which states have shelter-in-place or social-distancing policies in place at the time the forecast is made and assumes a reduced intervention effectiveness after shelter-in-place orders are lifted.

  This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease dynamics.  
  This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing and stay-at-home orders. 
  Infections are seeded stochastically with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. 
  Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within counties. 
  Social distancing and stay-at-home orders were applied and lifted at the state level according to the most recent policy documents. 
  After stay-at-home orders end, social distancing remains in effect through the end of the simulation with a roughly 75% reduction in effectiveness relative to that from stay-at-home orders. 
  To model deaths in the population, we incorporated realistic time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to standardize the probability of transition through these states by county.
  We estimate county-level seeding time and amount, the baseline county reproductive number, and the effectiveness of county-level stay-at-home and social distancing interventions with an MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to deaths reported by USA Facts. Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.
  The estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes, infection fatality ratio) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
