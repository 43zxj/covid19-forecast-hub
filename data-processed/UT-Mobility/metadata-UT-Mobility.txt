This model makes predictions assuming that social distancing patterns, as measured by anonymized mobile-phone GPS traces, remain constant in the future.  However, we receive this data in real time to update forecasts on a weekly basis.  

methods_long: >-

For each US state, we use local data from mobile-phone GPS traces made available by [SafeGraph] to quantify the changing impact of social-distancing measures on ``flattening the curve.''  SafeGraph is a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from numerous applications in order to provide insights about physical places. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes census block group information if fewer than five devices visitedan establishment in a month from a given census block group.  These data are aggregated by state to create metrics of social distancing, which are used as predictors in the model.

We use an SEIR-based model, where the infection rate is allowed to vary according to social distancing behavior from SafeGraph.  We updated our model on May 25, 2020, and are currently working on a technical report of the updated model.
