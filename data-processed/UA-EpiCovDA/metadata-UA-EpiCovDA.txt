  EpiCovDA is an extension of the EpiGro model. To combine Covid-19 data with the model
  during the pandemic, a variational data assimilation  method is used (sometimes called 
  4D-Var) to fit model parameters. For the data assimilation piece of EpiCovDA, a  prior 
  distribution of the parameters was estimated by fitting the model to states whose
  epidemic curves were further along early during the pandemic.
