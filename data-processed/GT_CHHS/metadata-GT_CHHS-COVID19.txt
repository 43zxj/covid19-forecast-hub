    Agent-based simulation model to project COVID19 infection spread.

methods_long: >-
    We developed an agent-based simulation model to predict the spread of COVID19 geographically and over time. The model captures both the
    natural history of the disease and interactions in households, workplaces, schools, and communities. The model was populated
    with COVID19 parameters from the literature and population-related data from the state of Georgia, including demographic information,
    household sizes, and travel patterns, and validated using data regarding COVID19 confirmed cases and deaths in Georgia.
