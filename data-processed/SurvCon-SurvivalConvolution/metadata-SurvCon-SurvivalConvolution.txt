    A robust survival-convolution model with few parameters that incorporates the date of unknown patient zero, 
    latent incubation periods, and time-varying reproduction numbers.

    Countries around the globe have implemented unprecedented measures to mitigate 
    the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aim to predict COVID-19 disease course 
    and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making 
    using a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model. We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic
    incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) to reflect the temporal trend 
    of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect 
    on reducing the transmission rate using a natural experiment design and quantify uncertainty by permutation. 
    In the United States, Rt significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, 
    but declines at a much slower rate afterwards. If the trend continues after May 1, COVID-19 may be controlled by 
    late July. However, a loss of temporal effect (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead 
    to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (mid November with less than 100 daily cases) and a total of more 
    than 2 million cases.
