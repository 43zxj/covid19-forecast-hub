methods: We combine recurrent neural networks with a vector autoregressive model and
    train the joint model with a specific regularization scheme that increases the
    coupling between regions. This approach is akin to using Granger causality as a
    relational inductive bias and helps training of high-resolution models by
    borrowing statistical strength across regions.
