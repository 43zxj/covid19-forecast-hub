methods: The forecasts are an ensemble of multiple methods such as auto-regressive (AR) models with exogenous variables, Long short-term memory () deep learning models, and PatchSim (an SEIR model) with interventions incorporated. 
methods_long: "This is a Virginia county-level multi-method model forecasting the new confirmed cases. Multiple methods include AR methods with exogenous variables such as
mobility, other county case counts time-series, an LSTM model with mobility data as additional predictor, and PatchSim, variant of SEIR with interaction between counties modeled using commuter data (model calibrated on new confirmed cases). The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging. Interventions are incorporated in PatchSim model‚Äù.
