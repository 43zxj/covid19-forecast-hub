# Repository of COVID-19 forecasts of deaths in the US

The goal of this repository is to create a standardized set of data on forecasts from experienced teams making projections of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States.

## Data license and reuse
We are grateful to the teams who have generated these forecasts. They have no doubt spent a huge amount of time and effort in a short amount of time to operationalize these important real-time forecasts. The groups have graciously and courageously made their public data available under different terms and licenses. You will find the licenses within the model-specific folders in the [data-raw](./data-raw/) directory. Please consult these licenses before using these data to ensure that you follow the terms under which these data were released.

We have stored the raw datafiles here as they were made available on the various websites. We are working on creating standardized versions of these files and on building a queryable API for easy access to the data contained in the forecasts.
